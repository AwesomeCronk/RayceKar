# Module layout
The engine is called RayceKar (pronounced like racecar). The best way to import it is `import raycekar as rk`.
* `coord` - `vec*`, `quat`, rad/deg conversions, etc
* `env` - scene container and 3d objects
* `events` - event system
* `gl` - `initialize`, `paint`, `updateScene`, etc
* `ui` - GLFW management and UI functions
* `util` - various bits and bobs used within RayceKar

# To do
* Add more shapes to env.py
* Flesh out UI a bit
* Custom shape system
* Start documenting things
